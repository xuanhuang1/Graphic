The program runs as hw3
All attributes lies in one vbo, indices lies in another vbo, 1 vao in total

The demo starts with deflate view, adding and deleting birds. 
Then speeding up, slowing down the goal, followed by switching to side view and trailing view.

The boids comes in a array of boids, with the maximumOfBoids+1 th index is the goal.
The total number of current boids is tracked for looping through the array.
draw the bodies first and then its shadow projected to xy plane with a z of 0.01
update the main vector then by adding:
	1. the vector towards goal
	2. the vectors of three rules applied
all with separate weighs. 

goal appears in a white boid, normal noids appear in red and yellow
submit -c 312 -p 4 -d hw4rworks2
key input
Toggling ‘p’ key to pause and resume 
		print goal’s and boids’  positions and rotating angles
	  ‘d’ key to single step when paused, 
		and steps continuously when held repeatedly

	‘+/-’ to increment or decrease number of boids on screen
	‘q/esc’ for exit
	‘left/right/up/down’ for goal, but no z axis turning, just position change
	‘v/s’ speed up and slow down
	‘w’ for default view
	’t’ for trailing view
	‘r’ for side view

Extra Credit:
	shadow is a vertical projection of boids on xy plane
